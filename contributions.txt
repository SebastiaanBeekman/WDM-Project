Nina Oosterlaar: Creating code for the logs, creating the ids microservice, contributed with testing fault tolerance, optimizing the final product.
Sebastiaan Beekman: I worked on the code for logging, developed fault tolerance, and created the tests. I also wrote the README and supported the group whene needed.

We all contributed equally to the architecture and design of the code.
